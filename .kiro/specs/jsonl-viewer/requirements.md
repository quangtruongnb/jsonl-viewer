# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing Wails application to provide a comprehensive JSONL (JSON Lines) file viewer. The application will allow users to open, browse, search, and analyze JSONL files through an intuitive desktop interface. JSONL files contain one JSON object per line and are commonly used for data streaming, logging, and bulk data storage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to load JSONL data from files or clipboard, so that I can view and analyze the data from multiple sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a "Open File" button THEN the system SHALL display a native file dialog
2. WHEN the user selects a .jsonl file THEN the system SHALL load and parse the file contents
3. WHEN the user clicks a "Paste from Clipboard" button THEN the system SHALL load JSONL data from the clipboard
4. IF the data is not a valid JSONL format THEN the system SHALL display an error message with specific line information
5. WHEN data is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL display the total number of JSON objects found
6. WHEN loading from clipboard THEN the system SHALL treat the pasted content as JSONL format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse through JSONL records in a structured format, so that I can easily read and understand the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JSONL file is loaded THEN the system SHALL display each JSON object in a formatted, readable view
2. WHEN displaying JSON objects THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for better readability
3. WHEN there are multiple records THEN the system SHALL provide pagination or virtual scrolling for performance
4. WHEN viewing a record THEN the system SHALL show the line number from the original file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through JSONL records, so that I can quickly find specific data or patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters text in a search box THEN the system SHALL filter records containing the search term
2. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text within the JSON objects
3. WHEN no matches are found THEN the system SHALL display a "No results found" message
4. WHEN search is cleared THEN the system SHALL show all records again

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between records efficiently, so that I can analyze large JSONL files without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large files THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling to maintain performance
2. WHEN scrolling through records THEN the system SHALL load records on-demand
3. WHEN jumping to a specific record THEN the system SHALL provide a "Go to line" functionality
4. WHEN at the beginning or end of the file THEN the system SHALL disable respective navigation buttons

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see file information and statistics, so that I can understand the structure and size of my JSONL data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is loaded THEN the system SHALL display the file name, size, and total record count
2. WHEN analyzing the data THEN the system SHALL show common field names across records
3. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL display the file path for reference
4. IF the file is modified externally THEN the system SHALL detect changes and offer to reload

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control which JSON fields are visible in the record display, so that I can focus on relevant data and reduce visual clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing records THEN the system SHALL provide a multi-select control to choose which fields to show
2. WHEN viewing records THEN the system SHALL provide a multi-select control to choose which fields to hide
3. WHEN fields are selected to show THEN the system SHALL display only those fields in the record view
4. WHEN fields are selected to hide THEN the system SHALL exclude those fields from the record view
5. WHEN no fields are selected to show THEN the system SHALL display all fields except those selected to hide
6. WHEN field visibility changes THEN the system SHALL immediately update the record display
7. WHEN a new file is loaded THEN the system SHALL reset field visibility settings to show all fields
